          <p>
            My name is Kevin, and I am a husabnd, father of 3, and have worked in the IT space over
            10 years. I have spent the last few years in what many refer to as web3. I`ve always had
            a passion for helping others. I was raised to treat others with kindness and compassion.
          </p>
          {/* tooltip:You the stuff about blockchains and crypto and those expensive jpeg images people are buying. */}
          <p>
            There are two goals I want to achieve. Improve mental health awareness for all ages, and
            help culture a world filled with more kindness and compassion.
